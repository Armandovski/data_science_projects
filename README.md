# Project 1: COVID vs. Insolation
## Description:
Comparison between the number of cases of COVID-19, recoveries and amount of insolation in the city of São José dos Campos.
## Motivation:
Given the number of studies linking Vitamin D to attenuation of COVID infection, I decided to verify if there was a local relationship between amount of solar radiation and COVID data.
## Status:
No obvious relationship was found. Project was put on hold. Possible future developments include considering other weather data and behavior of data throughout the christmas and new year period. The plot from the beginning of the pandemic until the last update is included in the Jupyter notebook for reference.
